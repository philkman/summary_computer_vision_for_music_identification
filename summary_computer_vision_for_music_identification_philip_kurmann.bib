    abstract = {We describe how certain tasks in the audio domain can be effectively addressed using computer vision approaches. This paper focuses on the problem of music identification, where the goal is to reliably identify a song given a few seconds of noisy audio. Our approach treats the spectrogram of each music clip as a 2-D image and transforms music identification into a corrupted sub-image retrieval problem. By employing pairwise boosting on a large set of Viola-Jones features, our system learns compact, discriminative, local descriptors that are amenable to efficient indexing. During the query phase, we retrieve the set of song snippets that locally match the noisy sample and employ geometric verification in conjunction with an EM-based "occlusion" model to identify the song that is most consistent with the observed signal. We have implemented our algorithm in a practical system that can quickly and accurately recognize music from short audio samples in the presence of distortions such as poor recording quality and significant ambient noise. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in content-based music identification.},

  TITLE={Random Sample Consensus: A Paradigm for Model Fitting with Applications
     to Image Analysis and Automated Cartography},
  JOURNAL={Communications of the ACM},

  NUMBER={6},
  VOLUME={24},
  YEAR={1981},
  ABSTRACT={A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model
     to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing
     data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally
     suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is
     based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion
     of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination
     Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with know locations,
     determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response
     to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks
     needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these
     minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis
     for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing.}

    title = {Pairwise Boosted Audio Fingerprint},
    abstract = {A novel binary audio fingerprint obtained by filtering and then quantizing the spectral centroids is proposed. A feature selection algorithm, coined pairwise boosting (PB), is used to determine the filters and quantizers by casting the fingerprinting problem of identifying a query audio clip into a binary classifica- tion problem. The PB algorithm selects the filters and quantizers which lead to accurate classification of matching and nonmatching audio pairs: a matching pair is an audio pair that should be classified as being identical, and a nonmatching pair is a pair that should be classified as being different. By iteratively reducing the classification error of both matching and nonmatching pairs, the PB algorithm improves both the robustness and discriminating ability. In our experiments, the proposed fingerprint outperformed previously reported binary fingerprints in terms of robustness and discriminating ability. In the experiment, we compared the performances of a number of distance measures.},
